Contingency Planning
First of all, what is a contingency?
A Contingency is a future event or circumstance that is possible but connot be predicted with certainty. (Need Reference)

Lets meet the trifecta of Contingency Planning:
 - Incident Response
 - Disaster Recovery
 - Business Continuity
 
All three of these are distinct, but interrelated processes.

Lets take a look at what a timeline would look like with all three of these:

<<Insert timeline graphic>>
 
Why do we need to talk about this?

  The 9/11 disaster required many companies to put their disaster recovery plans into action
  Information Week report: 
    25% of organizations surveyed had to invoke their disaster recovery or business continuity plans in 2003
    70% doing so reported the disaster as severe or extremely severe
  Almost 80% of businesses affected by a major incident either never reopen or close within 18 months
  Every organization must create, implement, and test effective plans to deal with incidents and disasters

Fringe Benefits
  Many make a career out of Incident Response, Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning and it can be quite rewarding.
  There are many industry certifications that can be maintained for all three areas of concentration. Some examples include:
   - Certified Incident Handler
   - DRI International (Many)
   - Business Continuity Institute
   - MBCP / CBCP

Where does this sit within the organization?

While many of these concepts are business issues, many contingencies are I.T. related or are information security incidents so we need to understand basic information security concepts

Information Security (InfoSec)
Protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in storage, during processing, or in transmission

We need to discuss Terminology

Threat
Category of objects, persons, or other entities that pose a potential risk of loss to an asset
Asset
A protected organizational resource
Logical asset: Web site, information, or data
Physical asset: person, computer system, building, vehicle, other tangible objects
Attack
An intentional or unintentional attempt to cause damage or otherwise compromise information or assets; AKA “realization of a threat”
Threat-agent
A specific and identifiable instance of a general threat
Vulnerability
A weakness or fault in the protection mechanisms for organizational assets
Well-known vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities that have been examined, documented, and published
Exploit
Illegal use of a system or information asset
A targeted solution to misuse a specific hole or vulnerability
Control, safeguard, or countermeasure
Security mechanisms, policies, or procedures to successfully counter attacks, reduce risk, resolve vulnerabilities, and improve security

Lets talk about some examples
Threats
Human Error / Failure
Unauthorized Access (Hack?)
Blackmail
Deliberate Destruction
Forces of Nature
Power issues / Network issues
Equipment Failure
Data Leakage (Hack?)
Outdated technology / Software
Loopholes, code issues, bugs
Pandemic / Epidemic
Acts of war

Assets
TWO CATEGORIES
 - Physical
 - Logical

Physical
Computers
Servers
Networking equipment
Mobile Devices
Paper
Buildings

Logical
Software
Intellectual Property
Code
Processes / Procedures
Data

Attacks
Malware / Viruses / Ransomware
Hack
Social Engineering
Nature
Physical
Entry to building
Destruction

Vulnerabilities
Code errors
Human factor
Configuration Errors
Accidental omission
Culture (non-profit example)
Obsolete Systems

Controls
Two Types:
Detective
Audits
Reports
Tools (IDS)
Cameras / Recording

Proactive
Policies
Logical barriers 9firewalls)
Authentication
Physical Barriers
Key Card Access
Procedures


Risk Management
Definition of Risk Management: Process of identifying vulnerabilities and taking carefully reasoned steps to minimize the impact of contingencies on organizational operations and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems

Why are we talking about this?
Prerequisite for everything we do
Often short-cutted
No real standard or common template
It is the road map for us to proceed
Helps us with where to spend the money!
