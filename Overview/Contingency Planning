Contingency Planning
First of all, what is a contingency?
A Contingency is a future event or circumstance that is possible but connot be predicted with certainty. (Need Reference)

Lets meet the trifecta of Contingency Planning:
 - Incident Response
 - Disaster Recovery
 - Business Continuity
 
All three of these are distinct, but interrelated processes.

Why do we need to talk about this?

  The 9/11 disaster required many companies to put their disaster recovery plans into action
  Information Week report: 
    25% of organizations surveyed had to invoke their disaster recovery or business continuity plans in 2003
    70% doing so reported the disaster as severe or extremely severe
  Almost 80% of businesses affected by a major incident either never reopen or close within 18 months
  Every organization must create, implement, and test effective plans to deal with incidents and disasters
